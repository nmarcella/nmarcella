### Hi there 👋

I'm Nick, a scientist with the Joint Photon Institute at Stony Brook University. I'm interested in developing solutions to fun materials science problems with Python!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on machine learning models for analyzing X-ray spectroscopy data, methods for automating theoretical X-ray calculations, and methods for validating molecular dynamics simulations with EXAFS and XANES.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize code for deployment on high-performance clusters, and I'm also improving my AI skills.
- ✨ Until recently, most of my coding work was done on my local computer. I intend to use Github more regularly in the coming months as I incorporate Git into my project management workflow.
