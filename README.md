### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick, and I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Brookhaven National Lab. I'm interested in developing solutions to fun materials science problems with Python!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning models for analyzing X-ray spectroscopy data, methods for automating theoretical X-ray calculations, and OVITO-based methods for extracting useful parameters from molecular dynamics simulations of nanoparticles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to optimize code for deployment on high performance clusters.
- âœ¨ Until recently, most of my coding work was done on my local computer. I intend to use Github more regularly in the coming months as I incorporate Git into my project management workflow.
